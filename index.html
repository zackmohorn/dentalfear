                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reasons for dental fear in children</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Dental fear in children is a complex topic and the reasons behind one child’s fear are often very different from the next child. This is because <strong>each child perceives, processes, and reacts to stressors differently</strong>. Understanding dental fear in children and how to manage it is an important topic because it is often a major reason for behavioral issues in the dental office and a barrier to oral healthcare.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Research studies indicate that many children fear the dentist because of fear of the noise in a dental setting. Specifically, many children fear the <strong>sound of a dental drill</strong>. Coupled with the bright lights and unfamiliar setting, it is easy to see why noise may add to a child’s overstimulation and anxiety in the dental office. Audiovisual distraction techniques such as watching TV or listening to music through headphones have been found to help relieve much of the anxiety associated with noise at the dentist. Research also shows that having to <strong>wait in the reception area, previous negative dental experience, parental dental anxiety,</strong> administration of <strong>local anesthesia, fear of the unknown,</strong> and <strong>tooth extraction</strong> are also major reasons for dental fear in children. Though these procedures are often unavoidable, there are many contributing factors that have been found to influence the degree of fear that the child feels. For example, children often favor a decorated dental clinic as opposed to a plain clinic and prefer that their dentist wear a coat as it helps them associate the dentist with a figure of healing. Studies have indicated that most children prefer a colored coat as opposed to a white one. A positive first dental visit has also been found to lead to less dental fear in subsequent appointments. Though the situation and level of fear will vary with each child, by being aware of the common causes of dental fear in children, parents can be better prepared to help their child deal with their particular fear.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Parent's effect on child's dental fear</h2>
                    <p class="lead">A pediatric dentist is one who specifically helps children with their dental health and needs. Among the many factors that influence a child’s dental fear, research has shown that <strong>parental attitude</strong> has a profound impact on the <strong>child’s view of the dentist</strong>. The parent’s outlook on the dentist can naturally transfer to the child and thus, it is important that the parent is cognizant of how they are acting in the dental office in front of their child.</p>
                    <p class="lead">For example, a parent can often pass on his or her own dental anxiety to a child. Generally, the anxiety a parent has about visiting the dentist developed during childhood and this resulting negative attitude toward dental visits can serve as a model for anxiety in children, especially when the child is four years old or younger. Parents often show this fear by questioning the dental treatment of their child and interfering with dental treatment. Sometimes, a parent may also relay stories about their poor dental experiences to the child. All of these factors combined act to reinforce the idea that dental visits are unpleasant and scary.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Once you find a pediatric dentist, communication is key. Voice your apprehension to the dentist but avoid doing so in front of the child. This will encourage transparency and build trust with your child’s dentist over time while avoiding eliciting anxiety in your child.</p>
                    <h3>How can you help as a parent?</h3>
                    <ul class="lead">
                      <li>Try to refrain from voicing apprehensions about the dentist in front of the child</li>
                      <li>Educate the child on the importance of going to the dentist and caring for their teeth</li>
                      <li>Have the child visit the dentist at an early age (as early as the first birthday is acceptable) </li>
                      <li>Ask your pediatric dentist if a “pre-appointment” can be made to familiarize yourself and the child with the office and dental environment</li>
                      <li>Communicate your fears with the dentist and have a conversation about tailoring your child’s treatment to best meet their needs. Your pediatric dentist may offer oxygen or nitrous oxide as an option to help relax the child during dental procedures.</li>
                      <li>Use positive reinforcements and encouragement after your child has a successful appointment (i.e. “if you behave your best for Dr. Dentist, you will have a great smile and we can go to the park afterward to play!”). Positive reinforcement has been proven to ease dental fear in children.</li>

                      <h2 class="section-heading">Behavior Management of kids with dental fear</h2>
                      <p class="lead">A number of strategies for parents exist that can help an anxious or fearful child be successful in the dental chair. The parent can play a major role in encouraging a child’s positive response to dental treatment. One of the most important things a parent can do is to be willing to work with the dentist as a team. A parent knows his or her child best and can provide important information about the child’s preferences and attitudes. A great way for a parent to be a team player is to help the child become more familiar with the dental environment. This process is called <strong>‘desensitization’</strong>. During desensitization, a child can be made more familiar with the dentist’s office over time. Even before treatment begins, a child can get comfortable with the office, the staff, and the tools the dentist will use during an exam. Over time, the child may even consider parts of the treatment to be fun!</p>
                      <p class="lead">Other behavior management techniques that can be used in the dental office include <strong>distraction techniques</strong> to divert the child’s attention away from the procedure or discomfort at hand. Giving a child headphones to listen to calming music or a screen to watch television on has been found to lessen a child’s anxiety. <strong>Positive reinforcement</strong> such as praising a child for good behavior in the dental chair or awarding the child a “prize” from a toy box may also motivate a child to exhibit good behavior during treatment. Other children have shown a positive behavioral response to the <strong>“tell-show-do”</strong> method in which the dentist explains the procedure to be performed in simple terms to the child, acts out a demonstration, and then performs the treatment. This helps the child know what to expect and can help lessen anxiety and lead to good behavior.</p>
                      <h3>Key Points</h3>
                      <ul class="lead">
                        <li>Managing a child’s behavior involves the patient, the parent, and the dentist: all three individuals must work together for the success of the appointment.</li>
                        <li>Desensitization is one of the best ways a parent can help a child</li>
                        <li>Other behavior management strategies include distraction, positive reinforcement, and the “tell-show-do” method</li>

                      <h3>What is hypnosis?</h3>
                      <p class="lead">When a person is in a state of mind that resembles sleep, and he/she accepts a proposal put to him/her by another, without having a logical reason for doing what is suggested.</p>
                      <h3>Why would you want hypnosis for your child?</h3>
                      <ul class="lead">
                        <li>To prevent extreme dental fear and anxiety, help with pain control, increase tolerance for orthodontic appliances, or eliminate oral habits such as thumb sucking, grinding/clenching teeth. It’s usually used when other methods such as behavior reinforcement or medication intake have failed.</li>
                        <li>Minimizing dental fear can eliminate the possibility of irregular dental visits and thus reduce greater damage to the teeth.</li>
                        <li>Children over the age of 5 are often hypnotized with ease because their vivid imaginations and blind trust make them extremely susceptible to suggestions.</li>
                        <li>It’s inexpensive and has a very low risk of side effects.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>How does hypnosis work?</h3>
                      <ul class="lead">
                        <li>The dentist can perform hypnosis.</li>
                        <li>Relaxation of the patient is the first step for starting hypnosis. This helps remove nervousness, fear, anxiety, and tension the patient may have when undergoing hypnosis. A couple of phrases used are:</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>“Get as comfortable as possible, rest your head, and notice your eyelids getting very heavy...” or “As I count to 10 your body will get more relaxed as you begin to enter a deep sleep...”</li>
                          </ul>
                        <li>Once your child is relaxed, verbal and visualization techniques are commonly used for hypnosis. The child can focus on an image or stuffed animal, imagine him/herself in a scene that is being described to the child by the dentist, or listen to music or a movie. <br> Examples:</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>The doctor can draw “Mickey Mouse” on his/her thumbnails and have a series of funny events revolved around Mickey Mouse.</li>
                            <li>A picture or a scenario is used that allows the child to imagine that he/she is a cartoon character on an imaginary T.V. screen.</li>
                            <li>The child can play with an actual or an imaginary video/computer game.</li>
                          </ul>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>Results from Hypnosis</h3>
                        <ul class="lead">
                          <li>Children must be told what to expect from procedures as they are being hypnotized. If this is not done, hypnosis will often be unsuccessful and resistance to future hypnosis may result.</li>
                          <li>Studies have shown that when children are hypnotized, they experience less anxiety and pain related to dental anesthesia and dental procedures.</li>

                        <p class="lead">Because of dental fear, children may be unable to follow instructions that the dentist gives, even though the instructions are often given to keep the patient safe.  As we have mentioned in the previous sections, there are a number of ways to prevent or manage fear and anxiety concerning trips to the dentist, but sometimes all of these techniques are still unable to allow for safe and comfortable treatment. In this case, cavities may form and plaque or tartar may build up in the child’s mouth because the family will begin to avoid treatment altogether. Avoiding treatment can potentially result in future dental care that is more traumatic to the child (pulling teeth or developing infection) than placing a filling would have been. In these more severe instances of fear, sedation may be considered during dental treatment.</p>
                        <p class="lead">The overall goal of dental sedation during treatment is to keep the child calm, but have them remain conscious. Based on your dentist’s previous clinical experience, he or she will often administer one of many different drugs (maybe midazolam mixed in juice, for example) in combination with nitrous oxide.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Though sedation may help alleviate the fear and anxiety that your child associates with dental visits, it is important to consider all factors before sedating your child. At different times, sedation may not be fully effective and may require that the patient return for treatment at a later time, which could be distressing and complicated. Additionally, if too much sedative is given, the child may lose consciousness. Finally, placing your child under sedation may be a more costly procedure than initially planned. Because there is no true uniform medicine, administration technique, or dose, it is critical that you discuss all of these factors with your doctor before proceeding to use dental sedation on your child.</p>
